      <p>Typography is a very important concept that is invisible to most of us. It is present on literally everything we read and can have a deep impact on how we perceive things. Wikipedia defines it as follows:</p>

      <blockquote>Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.</blockquote>

      <p>Choosing the appropriate font is a huge part of making a website and, with this in mind, I decided to take some notes after taking a course on typography on <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/library/web-typography">Treehouse</a>.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id="terminology"> Terminology</h2>

      <p>There are some specific terms on typography that can make your life much easier when trying to talk about it. Words are tools for communication, so let's grab the right ones.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span>Typeface</span> &mdash; The design of a collection of characters. A typeface comprises multiple fonts.</li>

        <li><span>Font</span> &mdash; A single instance or embodiment of a specific weight, width, or style of a typeface.</li>

        <li><span>Cap Height</span> &mdash; The height of the capital letters.</li>

        <li><span>Baseline</span> &mdash; Guideline where the marjority of characters rest.</li>

        <li><span>x-height</span> &mdash; The height of the lowercase x, which is the height of the lowercase letters.</li>

        <li><span>Descenders and Ascenders</span> &mdash; Parts of specific letters that go under the baseline or above the cap height.</li>

        <li><span>Serifs</span> &mdash; Projections that finish off the main strokes of a letter.</li>

        <li><span>Contrast</span> &mdash; Could talk about form (where high contrast means thick vertical strokes and thin horizontal strokes) or difference between the letters' and the background's colors.</li>

        <li><span>Color</span> &mdash; Could talk about the actual color, but also about the weight and density of ink.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>

      <h2 id="types">Types of Type</h2>

      <p>Different kinds of typefaces convey different moods and personalities, so knowing the different genres of typefaces help us see how the typeface is talking. Let's focus on three genres and see their subgenres.</p>

      <h3 id='serifs'>Serif</h3>

      <p>Serifs originated in the Latin alphabet with inscriptional lettering &mdash; words carved into stone in Roman antiquity. Serif fonts can be broadly classified into one of five subgroups, which we'll discuss next.</p>

      <h4 id='humanist' class='face humanist'>Humanist Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>The grandparent of almost all popular serif faces today, humanist typefaces succeeded our Blackletter friends between 1460 and 1470, and were modeled after early Italian humanist writers.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: Sloping crossbar on the lowercase &ldquo;e&rdquo;, small x-height, low contrast between strokes, dark &ldquo;color&rdquo; meaning you can see an overal value to the page. (<a href="https://www.copypress.com/blog/lets-talk-about-type-serif-humanist-and-old-style/">source</a>)</p>

      <h4 id='old-style' class='face old-style'>Old Style Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Old style typefaces began from mimicking the handwriting of Italian scholars, like Humanist typefaces , but they marked a distinct departure from this more calligraphic style.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: greater contrast between thick and thin strokes, the serifs on the ascenders are more wedge shaped, the stress of the letterforms are more perpendicular, the adoption of a horizontal crossbar in the letter &ldquo;e&rdquo;, greater refinement than humanist faces as the skills of type cutters was steadily improving. (<a href="https://www.copypress.com/blog/lets-talk-about-type-serif-humanist-and-old-style/">source</a>)</p>

      <h4 id='transitional' class='face transitional'>Transitional Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Transitional typefaces appear, as the name suggests, as a transition between old style and modern/didone. Times New Roman is a transitional typeface.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: medium x-height and relatively short ascenders and decenders, high contrast between thick and thin strokes, the weight is distributed according to a vertical axis, more horizontal head serifs, a greater focus on horizontal and vertical lines, and more gradually curved serifs. (<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-a-transitional-serif-typeface">source</a>)</p>

      <h4 id='didone' class='face didone'>Didone Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Emerged in the late 18th century and was the standard style of general-purpose printing during the 19th.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: narrow and unbracketed (hairline) serifs with nearly constant width along their length, vertical orientation of weight axes with thick vertical strokes, strong contrast between thick and thin lines with horizontal parts very thin in comparison to the vertical parts, an unornamented, modern appearence. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Didone_(typography)">source</a>)</p>

      <h4 id='slab' class='face slab'>Slab Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Slab typefaces were invented in and most popular during the 19th century. They form a large and varied genre, from typefaces with geometric design with minimal variation in stroke width to ones with a structure more like most other serif fonts, but with larger and more obvrious serifs.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: low contrast, thick, block-like serifs, serif terminals that may be blunt and angular or rounded, a more mechanical look. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slab_serif">source</a>)</p>


      <h3 id='sans-serifs'>Sans-Serif</h3>
      <p>Sans-serif typefaces are ones that don't have serifs. They tend to be have less line width variation than serif typefaces. They are usually used for headings rather than for body text and are often used to convey the idea of simplicity and modernity or minimalism. They can be divided into four main categories.</p>
      <h4 id='grotesque' class='face grotesque'>Grotesque Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Influenced by Didones, Grotesque were often quite solid and bold, suitable for headlines and advertisements.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: limited variation of stroke width, terminals of curves often horizontal, cap height and ascender height are usually the same, and descenders are often short. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Grotesque">source</a>)</p>

      <h4 id='neo-grotesque' class='face neo-grotesque'>Neo-Grotesque Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Neo-Grotesque typefaces are relatively straightforward in appearance with limited width variation. Unlinke grotesque, many were issued in extremely large and versatile families, making them easier to use for body text. Helvetica, the most used typeface in the world, is an example of a neo-grotesque typeface.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: capitals are often of uniform width, folded-up design in which strokes are curved all the way around to end on a perfect horizontal or vertical line (like in &ldquo;c&rdquo;), focus on simplicity, almost neutral typefaces. (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Neo-grotesque">source</a>)</p>

      <h4 id='humanist-sans' class='face humanist-sans'>Humanist Sans Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Humanist sans-serifs take inspiration from traditional letterforms, such as Roman square capitals, traditional serif fonts and calligraphy. These are the most legible of the sans-serifs.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: they vary more than gothic or geometric designs, they show stroke modulation or alternating thick and thin strokes, some are more geometric with half-squares and circles and considerable variation in width.(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Humanist">source</a>)</p>

      <h4 id='geometric' class='face geometric'>Geometric Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>As their name suggests, Geometric sans-serif typefaces are based on geometric shapes, like near-perfect circles and squares. Usually, this is the least useful sans-serif for body text and it's often used for headings and small passages of text.</p>
      <p>Defining characteristics are: geometric shapes, nearly-exactly circular capital &ldquo;O&rdquo;, single-story lowercase &ldquo;a&rdquo;, capital &ldquo;M&rdquo; of varying widths (following the classical model). (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif#Geometric">source</a>)</p>

      <h3 id='scripts'>Scripts</h3>
      <p>Script typefaces are based upon the varied and often fluid stroke created by handwriting. They are organized into highly regular formal types similar to cursive writing and looser, more casual scripts.</p>
      <h4 id='formal' class='face formal'>Formal Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Formal typefaces are inspired by writing masters of the XVII and XVIII centuries. They use shapes like those of letters made by a quill or metal nib of a pen. Both are able to create fine and thick strokes.</p>

      <h4 id='casual' class='face casual'>Casual Typefaces:<br/>
      The Quick Brown Fox Jumps Over The Lazy Dog.</h4>
      <p>Instead of serious and elegant, casual typefaces are casual, light-hearted, and even comedic. The strokes may vary in width but often appear to have been created by wet brush rather than a pen nib.</p>

      <h3 id='numbers'>Numbers</h3>

      <p>Numbers can also present variations, and we'll focus on two types.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span>Old style</span> &mdash; (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0) Vary in height and sometimes have descenders (which is nice for text)</li>
        <li><span>Lining Figures</span> &mdash; (<span class="lining">1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0</span>) All numbers are the same height (which is good for display)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id='choosing-type-text'>Choosing a typeface for text</h2>

      <p>This should be chosen first, as it serves as reference point for the typographic composition. The most important thing in the text typeface is that it is easy to read. With that in mind, here's a list of things to consider when choosing a text typefaces:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><span>x-height</span> &mdash; An x-height of 60% to 75% of the cap height is ideal. Go too high or too low and legibility is affected.</li>
        <li><span>Letter-space</span> &mdash; The letters need space to breath, so make sure they are not crammed together.</li>
        <li><span>Even contrast</span> &mdash; The letters shouldn't look like they have different weights. If a text seems to be bold when the reader looks away but is, in fact, normal, this is distracting.</li>
        <li><span>Counters</span> &mdash; The empty space inside letters like &ldquo;o&rdquo; and &ldquo;e&rdquo; can help the reader identify the letter, so pay attention to them, especially when using larger weights.</li>
        <li><span>Typeface mood should match content's</span> &mdash; Familiarize yourself with the content and use simple words to describe its mood. Then, see if the typeface matches that mood, but <em>never sacrifice legibility for mood</em>. Text is meant to be read and, if it can't be read, all the work of choosing the typeface that has the right mood is lost.</li>
        <li><span>Ask yourself things like</span> &mdash; Does this typeface has a nice range of weights? Does it have italics? Will we need different widths for versatility? Are small caps necessary? Do we need language support? What kind of numerical figures are needed? Let all these things guide your decision.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id='choosing-type-display'>Choosing a typeface for display</h2>
      <p>The typeface used for headings and display can be large and have a lot more personality, but it should still be legible and readable. It can have short ascenders and descenders, and play around with shapes and weights to grab the attention of the reader.</p>
      <p>In display fonts there's more room for mood and personality, but remember: with more room for mood comes more responsibility. Also, you should identify your audience and play into what they know. You can use typefaces similar to iconic movie logos, or that seem to have come from the page of a comic book, or from the screen of an old computer. Just make sure it fits the content and that the target audience will feel comfortable reading it (or <em>un</em>comfortable, if that's the reaction you are going for).</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id='rhythm'>Vertical Rythym</h2>

      <p>Vertical rythym is essential for body text. After taking a glance at a text for a few seconds, our brain can identify patterns, and breaking these patterns can be uncomfortable for the reader. Images and different text elements like lists and blockquotes are good for balancing the page, but the vertical rhythm of the text should keep unaltered after these different elements.</p>
      <p>Line height is one of the characteristics that determine the vertical rhythm of the text. The line height influences how tight the text looks and 1.5 is usually good (multiplying this number by the font size gives you your absolute line height). Large line height in text can be complimented by small line heights in display.</p>
      <p>Vertical rhythm refers to the fact that, even when broken by headlines and images, the text should fall on evenly-spaced lines, and <a href="http://basehold.it/">Basehold.it</a> can help with that (the number basehold.it uses to draw the lines is the line height of the text).</p>
      <p>When fixing vertical rhythm, tie headings to the paragraphs bellow and separate from paragraphs above.</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id='scale'>Scale</h2>

      <p>Following a typographic scale helps you keep consistency. The classic typographic scale increases in steps of 1 (from 6 to 12), 2 (from 12 to 18), 3 (from 18 to 24), and 12 (from 24 to 120). This scale has been used for centuries and it's especially reliable if you're using 16 pixels as base size.</p>
      <p>Go to <a href="https://type-scale.com/">Type Scale</a> for a visual calculator. It's a nice tool that makes it easy to choose a scale &mdash; it even gives you the css you need!</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2 id='attention'>Things to pay attention to</h2>

      <p>Finally, there are some things to which you should pay attention. The <em>measure</em> is the line length in a body of text and is an important unit to make the reading of the text comfortable. Short measures are better for reading, but too short and they become impossible to read. To make sure you have a good measure, try to keep it between 45 and 75 characters per line by marking these positions with asterisks and redimensioning the text. Aim for 60 characters per line.</p>
      <p>Use smart quotes (open &ldquo; and close &rdquo; quotes are different than ") and other proper entities (&mdash;, &ndash;, &hellip;). To create even alignment for quotations and lists, use markers starting with the paragraphs, not indented. Lastly, use icon fonts instead of raster graphics everywhere you can.</p>
      <p>As a final step, check for orphans (single words alone in the last line), widows (single sentences in the last line), rags (the irregular space left on the right by left-align), and rivers (empty space between words in justified text) in your text. Rags and rivers are ok, as long as they don't take atention away from the content, but orphans and widows can be uncomfortable and should be fixed if possible.</p>
